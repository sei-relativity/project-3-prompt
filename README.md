## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, arrays, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build interactive web pages. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data t
hey input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS & JavaScript, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **AJAX**: Using Axios to make asynchronous JavaScript calls.
- **React**: A front end framework for building modern web applications.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **SQL**: SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
- **Ruby**: Ruby programming fundamentals including Object Oriented Programming with Classes and Inheritance.
- **Ruby on Rails**: A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
